# Password Generator

## Description

An application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.

## Goals

In the internet age, lots of user information is stored online. In many cases, the only thing standing between your data and the hackers who want to steal it is a good password. This site is designed to create a secure and random password for use on any site that requires password authentication. 

## Installation

There's nothing to install! Just go to https://bonnerac.github.io/password-generator/ to start.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts

## How It Works

The user clicks on the **Generate Password** button to star the application. The user then has the option to choose what kinds of characters are included in their password. Their choices are:

* **Special Characters** 
* **Numbers** 
* **Capital Letters** 
* **Lowercase Letters** 
* **Number of Characters**

The user must select between one and four of the following choices:
* Special Characters
* Numbers
* Capital Letters
* Lowercase Letters

And a password length (between 8 and 128 characters)

The application will create a password using the user's options. If they don't pick at least one choice, or a correct character length, they will be directed to try again.

The user can also click the **Copy to Clipboard** button which takes the created password and copies it to the user's clipboard.
